###Where modern front-end tooling has gone ([Renato Mangini](https://twitter.com/renatomangini))
Forgot to take pictures of this one. Sorry.

Renato Mangini focused on tools for automating tasks, but instead of showing internally developed tools like Mauricio, [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [bower](http://bower.io/) were introduced. There was not a lot of technical details, but there is plenty of examples on the Internet for this tools. Another highlight of the talk was the little chat with [Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani). After Renato showed [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) for the audience, there was a failed attempt to release the 1.0 version in front of 1000 people. The wifi connection didn't help at all.

Zeke talked about some trends on Heroku's [buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks), more specifically about the Node.js one. He made [some](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs) [browser](https://github.com/zeke/forkie) [extensions](https://github.com/zeke/npm-hub) that helped identify what kind of things the community was building. The findings are well described on the slides, so there is not much else to say.

###Um futuro chamado Web Components ([Zeno Rocha](https://twitter.com/zenorocha))

This, for me, was the best talk of the conference. Zeno gave a crash course on [Web Components](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/explainer/index.html), demoing each of the technologies that make this possible. Aside from being a great public speaker, Zeno did a call to action and launched a [site for collaboration on new web components](http://customelements.io). When the videos come out, if only have time to watch one talk, this is the one you want to watch.
