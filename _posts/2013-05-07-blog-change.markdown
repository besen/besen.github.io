After posterous demise, I find myself in need of another service to host my blog. Not that I use it all that often, but the possibility of doing it is nice enough. Just like paying the gym membership.

With my back-up done, I decided I don't want to go through this again, so this time I'm using a more hands on aproach, using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as my bloging platform. I will host this on github pages for now, and when github closes, it should be much easier to migrate the blog, since this is also stored in my machine.

I will spend some time reformating and adding my old writings here. I also will tweak the layout a bit when I feel like it.
